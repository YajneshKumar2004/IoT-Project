# IoT-Project-
A Bluetooth-controlled remote car with ultrasonic obstacle detection using Arduino. This project combines manual mobile control with automated obstacle detection, enhancing safe navigation. The car halts and signals when an obstacle is detected, resuming movement once clear. A practical project for IoT, robotics, and sensor integration.
